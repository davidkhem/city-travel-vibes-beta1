# City Travel Vibes
## Problem
I want the users to experience the places they visit through photography.
The app provides them the best locations to shoot and pose within walking distance.
The location results are chosen by algorithm (which are other users’ votes, reviews, etc.).
The user doesn't need to open up multiple apps or go down the rabbit hole of google searching for spots.

## User:
* Young Adults, Budget Travelers
* Focusing on 18-30 years old age range
* Enjoy traveling and taking photos
* Love to share and comment
* Join a community of like-minded people

### User Journey:
* Log into the site
* Select/type the location you want into the search box
* Best photo locations result will populate.
* Sort by distance, rating, etc.
* Review results, then choose the best spots and path for efficiency.
* Save info to use later or to share with friends.
* Able to leave reviews/comments. Worth it or not.

## Competitions:
* Foursquare/Swarm:
    * They’re not focusing on photos, more on restaurants and services. People gathering, meetup spots.
* Yelp
    * They’re focus more on reviewing food and services.
* Google
    * Too broad. No app on organizing best photo locations all-in-one.
* Instagram
    * It doesn’t easily show you where the best photo locations.

## Process and Solution
I start off by brainstorming ideas to solve a problem I'm having. I love traveling to cool locations around the world and taking photos.
I can't find a simple all-in-one app that would just tell me the best place to take pictures that are close to me.
Then I thought of some features and design a few mock wireframes using Figma. The simple layouts will give me a visual on what app would look like.
Also, provide me a guide on how to start working the pages in the next stage of building the app.

To build the web app, I will use HTML, Tailwind CSS, and React. Tailwind CSS and MDN Web Docs websites will be a very helpful part of the process.
Issues that I think I will encounter are getting the features or components to work together and finding the right API to fetch data.
I create a User Journey that will help me imagine in my head the way the app will likely flow. Hope this will get people excited for the app.
